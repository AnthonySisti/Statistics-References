## Foundations of Causal Inference 

### Estimating causal effects of treatments in randomized and nonrandomized studies. Rubin, D. B. (1974)
- First publication laying the ground work for Rubin Causal Model (RCM). Ironically, only could get published in Journal of Educational Psychology.

### Bayesian Inference for Causal Effects: The Role of Randomization. Rubin, D. B. (1978)
- Describes the theory for causal inference via posterior predictive sampling of unobserved potential outcomes.

- Conceptual introduction to embedding your observational study in a target randomized trial.

### For objective causal inference, design trumps analysis Rubin, D. B. (2008).
- Additional emphasis for the importance of design decisions in observational studies.

## Analysis of Randomized Studies

### When possible, report a Fisher-exact P value and display its underlying null randomization distribution. Bind, M. A., & Rubin, D. B. (2020).
- Interesting article on the usefulness of the Fischer-exact P value in randomized experiments, and how it should be displayed rather than asymptotic P values
